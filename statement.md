
**SMART TRACK – CLI Based Attendance Management System**
## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a simple, fast, and efficient command-line tool that
allows teachers or administrators to manage student attendance digitally without the need for complex
software.
## Problem Statement
Traditional attendance-taking methods are often time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to
maintain over long periods. Manual registers may get lost, damaged, or filled with inaccuracies. There
is a need for a lightweight tool that simplifies attendance tracking and stores data securely.
## Proposed Solution
This project introduces a Python-based CLI system that enables:
- Adding and managing student records
- Marking day-wise attendance
- Viewing overall attendance reports
- Maintaining a JSON-based database for persistence
- Automatically calculating attendance percentage and status
## Key Functionalities
1. **Student Management**
- Add new students
- View all students
- Delete students along with historical attendance cleanup
2. **Attendance Marking**
- Take attendance for any date
- Auto-store present students
- Prevent duplicate attendance marking
3. **Analytics & Reporting**
- Total sessions held
- Student-wise present count
- Attendance percentage & performance status
## Technology Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **JSON** for data storage
## Conclusion
The SMART TRACK CLI system provides an efficient, accurate, and easy-to-use tool for attendance
management. It automates record keeping, minimizes errors, and provides meaningful insights into
student attendance trends.
